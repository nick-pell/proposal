# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snake Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

a replication of the popular 'Snake' computer game with various additions. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will utilize pygame to create a replication of 'Snake'. It will open a screen and take inputs from the user's arrow keys in order to play the game. The program will (hopefully) take a user's name and save their high score to a file and users will be able to view other scores of players that have played locally. I also hope to make it so that players can choose the color of the background and the color of the snake. I hope to implement a difficulty meter that allows the user to select the difficulty they wish to play at. Higher difficulty will have aspects like increased snake speed, the snake gains more length per pellet consumed, different map sizes, and dangerous spots/items the player must avoid. It will execute through visual studio code or an exe. ( Possibly other new additions/features that I come up with during the development of the game. )


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Replication of the basic 'Snake Game' with customizable colors

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Same as previous answer, but with the addition of the leaderboard and some of the difficulty options

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Same as the previous answers, but with the full addition of all difficulty options and more ideas that I may come up with along the way.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps involve researching pygame and gaining a solid understanding of how it works. I will also need to acquire some basic game development skills and learn about converting .py files to .exe's. Finally, I am sure that I will need to learn a lot about various different programming ideas and topics that I am currently unaware of, and that will require research in order to understand them during the making of this game.
